## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

This is my first time using react to make something usable. I'd say I've learned a lot about state and useEffect. In the future I plan to learn more about hooks and add more functionality to this app. Next, I'll add a functionality that lets you drag and drop tasks by order of priority.


### Useful resources

- [React.dev](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) - This helped me understand useEffect and how to properly use it in my project.
