## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Redux
- React-beautiful-dnd


### What I learned

I played around with redux and drag'n drop and complicated my life a little around this simple project. But, I'm happy that I succeeded in everything I wanted to do. In the future I hope to learn how to use Redux even more, and get some thunks in there as well.

### Useful resources

- [React.dev](https://react.dev/reference/react/useEffect) - This helped me understand useEffect and how to properly use it in my project.
- [Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createSlice) - Helped me understand how reducers work
